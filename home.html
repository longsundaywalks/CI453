                For example: This an example of a pop-up that is common among the internet.<br><br>
                It remains safe until clicked on. However, once you click on it multiple things can occur.<br><br>
                It will usually redirect you to a new website by opening a tab in your browser or a new window.<br><br>

    <h3> How can I be safe?  </h3>
        
    <p> There are many ways to be safe. We can identify the key methods that people use to <i>bait</i> people on the internet.</p>
    <p> <i>Phishing</i> is a very popular means of acquiring sensitive information that people often fall for.</p>
    <div class="brightness">
    <img src="images/phishing scam.png" alt="Phishing scam">
    <h4>What is phishing?</h4>
    <br>
    <p> <i>Phishing</i> can be remembered easily as it is similar to fishing. An attacker will <i>bait</i> a user into believing they are at risk and then reel in the profits of their misplaced trust.</p>
    <p>It is frequently targeted towards older people as they may be more unfamiliar with these methods of acquiring personal information. This practice can be performed in many ways but is most commonly seen in: scam-calls, scam text-messages and scam-emails.</p>
    <p> This is due to the ease of contacting the victim of these phishing attacks since gaining an email or home phone-number is relatively easy to an attacker.</p>

                Identity theft
            </h4>
        <br>
        <p> <i>Identity theft</i> is a practice that attackers use to pretend to be you on the internet.<br>
            This can be replicated with surprisingly little information, which reinforces the idea of you should be careful who you share personal information with.

        <h4> What to do if I am the victim of identity theft?</h4>
        <p> The first thing you should do is be certain. Check all details such as email, bank statements and any user accounts to see if there is evidence.<br>
            There are websites that can assist and support people during this time, such as Experian who can help check your credit report.<br>
            However, the most important and rapid response team you can contact is Action Fraud.

            <h2 class = "subheading"> Cyberbullying </h2>
        <br>
            <h4>What is cyber-bullying?</h4>
        <h3>The definition for Cyber-bullying is: "Cyber Bullying is the use of the Internet and related technologies to harm other people in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner." - Wikipedia </h3>
        <br>
        <p>There are numerous forms of cyber-bullying that occur across the internet.</p>
        <p>These can include:</p>
        <li>Harassment:</li>
        <p> Harassing someone online is never okay. This comes in the form of intentionally and repeatedly trying to get the attention of someone to cause them pain. </p>
        <li>Impersonation:</li>
        <p>Impersonating someone to cause harm to their image and reputation. This is done by using someone else's account and spreading malicious things online under the cover of someone else.</p>
        <li>Outing:</li>
        <p>Outing is most common by bullies preying on the vulnerabilities of victims. For example: If a bully sent sensitive information that a victim wouldn't want spread around it would be considered outing.</p>
        <li>Cyberstalking:</li>
        <p>Cyberstalking is a very dangerous method of cyber-bullying as it has many consequences usually out of the control of the bully. It is an extreme degree of harassment that instills fear in the victim as they are constantly threatened or feeling unsafe. </p>

            <h2 class = "subheading"> Mitigation </h2>
        <h4>What is mitigation?</h4>
        <p><i>Mitigation</i> is the process easing severity under the threat of an event. In the world of cyber-security this is easing the damage done under a cyber-attack. </p>
        <p>Reasons for these cyber-attacks come under different circumstances. People outside of an organisation may do so for financial gain, gaining revenge or even just to cause harm for entertainment. There is also the potential risk of someone inside an organisation causing damage if they feel bitter towards the company or are using their insight and power to damage.</p>
        <div class= "brightness">
            <img src ="images/mitigate.png" alt= "The cycle of mitigation">
        </div>
        <p><b>This is a cycle of understanding how to combat a cyber-attack by using mitigation techniques.</b></p>
            <li>Identify: Identify who has access to your information and control over it.</li>
            <li>Protect: Limit unnecessary employee access to information. </li>
            <li>Detect: Keeping track of prior installations and records is useful during this stage of investigation.</li>
            <li>Respond: When an incident has occurred, your readiness to respond will have an effect on how much of the damage is mitigated. Choosing who to reply to is critical.</li>
            <li>Recovery: One classic technical mechanism is making backups of your data.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Mitigation strategies are commonly used among almost all companies to minimize damage of a threat until the issue can be counter-measured.</p>
            <h5>The National Security Agency (NSA) from the US Government recommends the following strategies:</h5>
                <li>Update and Upgrade Software Immediately.</li>
                <li>Defend Privileges and Accounts</li>
                <li>Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies</li>
                <li>Exercise a System Recovery Plan</li>
                <li>Actively Manage Systems and Configurations</li>
                <li>Continuously Hunt for Network Intrusions</li>
                <li>Leverage Modern Hardware Security Features</li>
                <li>Segregate Networks Using Appliation-Aware Defenses</li>
                <li>Integrate Threat Reputation Services</li>
                <li>Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication</li>

    <section id = "privacyissues">
        <h2 class = "subheading"> Privacy issues </h2>
    
        <p>Privacy issues are a huge concern throughout the cyber-security world.</p>
        <p>Using personal data over the internet causes issues in terms of privacy and maintaining that when exchanging personal information.</p>
        <h4>What are privacy issues?</h4>
        <p>Privacy issues come in many forms. There are eight main problems to tackle when pursuing a secure standard in personal information management.</p>
        <h3>Mismanagement of personal information can have devastating consequences such as fines, ruining security or even prison time in extreme circumstances.</h3>
        <h4>So how do we protect ourselves and be safe on the internet?  </h4>
        <p>Protecting ourselves can be done through multiple different means and is essential for maintaining a confidential and protected flow of information that is secure.<br>
        Ways to be secure and confirm people's security can be done by doing the following:</p>
            <li>Embedding data privacy</li>
                <p>Ensuring that keeping data secure is at the front of your mind when developing is key. This approach keeps people safe and their information secure and maintains relevant and understandable information.</p>
                <p>A way that this is commonly implemented in numerous websites across the net is through <i>Anonymization.</i></p>
                <p>Keeping the information scrambled and anonymized ensures that nobody is at risk when demonstrating simple techniques or approaches in sharing data.</p>
                    <div class= "brightness"> 
                        <img src = "images/Anonymizationwrong.png"> 
                    </div>
                <p>This is an example of incorrect data privacy. As it uses an example of real information for the public to view. This information could be potentially dangerous for the individuals.</p>
                    <div class= "brightness">
                        <img src = "images/Anonymizationright.png">
                    </div>
                <p>However, this information is more secure. As on a large scale business standpoint with hundreds of users. Scrambling and censoring information is vital while still maintaining the correct layout remaining relevant to the public.</p>
            <li>Increase in device usage</li>
                <p>By increasing the amount of devices used in a company it increases risk of data violation and therefore can result in privacy issues in a company.<br>
                    Having many different kinds of devices can lead to having different operating systems and applications to manage.</p>
                <h5>Having methods in-place to combat security and privacy breaches on all applications is the best way of ensuring no personal information is stolen.</h5>
                <p>This is due to removing certain accessibility options and increasing the security on all devices.</p>
            <li>Paying for proper security to ensure no/few breaches </li>
                <p>The idea of cheaping out on strong security should never be considered as it builds the foundation of an enterprise to ensure nobody but those trusted can access vital information.<br>
                The cost of a data breach will always be much more problematic and cost substanstially more in information rather than money.</p>
                    <h4>So what's the best solution?</h4>
                <p>A good way to maintain your security is by having it <i>automated</i>.<br>
                Having a process automated is beneficial for several reasons as it removes manual control and gives an overall ease-of-use solution to an otherwise tedious method of control.<br>
                It can lower costs as well as you wouldn't require people to perform this process. <br>
                As well as substanstially decreasing human-error as there is less manual input.</p>
            <li>Security in an organisation</li>
                <p>Maintaining proper user controls inside of a company is important as it reduces the risk of an inside attack.<br>
                If you have someone working for your company that is soon to leave or has a distaste towards their job, it is vital to not give them power that may disrupt work-flow or cause havoc from inside the company.</p>
                <p>This can be performed by leaking information to outsider sources or utilizing permissions that they should not have access to!</p>
                    <h4>A poor workspace is one that is mismanaged...<br>
                    <br>
                    ...So how do we solve or remove this problem?</h4>
                <p>The simplest way to ensure no privacy attacks come from inside of the company is by proper management of the permissions that the users can operate.<br>
